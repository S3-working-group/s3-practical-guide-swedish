title: "Be om hjälp"
---


<strong>A simple protocol for learning, skill sharing, and building connections, with respect for people's agency.</strong>

Ask someone, "*would you be willing to help me with ...*?" The person asked accepts or declines with a simple "*yes*" or "*no*".

- if the request is declined, the person asking accepts the answer without negotiation or inquiry
- if the request is unclear, inquire for more information
- if you accept a request for help, support your peer in the best way you can
