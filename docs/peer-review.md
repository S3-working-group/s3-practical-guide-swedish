<strong>Support each other to learn and grow in the roles and teams you serve in.</strong>

The role keeper — or team — leads the peer review by setting up the process, and by speaking first in each step.

Ensure you invite people with complementary perspectives to contribute to the review, and a [facilitator](facilitate-meetings.html).

For both appreciations and improvement suggestions, ensure you consider the following aspects:

- The **value** the delegatee brought to the organization by accounting for the <a href="#" class="tooltip" title="Domän: A distinct area of influence, activity and decision making within an organization.">domain</a>.
- The role keeper’s or team’s **work processes**, and their **collaboration** with the <a href="#" class="tooltip" title="Delegator: An individual or group delegating responsibility for a domain to other(s).">delegator</a> and with other relevant stakeholders, and – in the case of a team - with each other.
- How well the **delegator** takes care of their responsibilities.
- The **design of the domain** itself (and potentially the design of other related domains).
- The role keeper’s or team’s **competencies and skills** in relation to the domain.
- The **<a href="#" class="tooltip" title="Strategi: A high level approach for how people will create value to successfully account for a domain.">strategy</a>** the role keeper or team follows to account for this domain.
