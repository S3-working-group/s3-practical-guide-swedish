If you arrived here from another language version of the practical guide, that is most likely because we renamed a pattern.

Consider taking a look at the  [&#9654;pattern index](pattern-index.html) or the  [&#9654;clickable pattern map index](map.html)  to find the pattern you're looking for, or go to the  [&#9654;home page](index.html)

You can also view [&#9654;everything on one page](all.html), or visit the [&#9654;S3 resources page ](https://sociocracy30.org/resources) to download this guide and other resources about S3.

This guide is currently available in [English](https://patterns.sociocracy30.org), [German](https://patterns-de.sociocracy30.org), [French](https://patterns-fr.sociocracy30.org), [Dutch](https://patterns-nl.sociocracy30.org) and [Hebrew](https://patterns-he.sociocracy30.org).
