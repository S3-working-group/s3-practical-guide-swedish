title: "Princip 7 – Samarbeta vid beroenden"
---



**_Samskapa och utveckla ett sammanhängande system för att hantera alla beroenden, så att värde levereras snabbt när beroenden inte kan undvikas._**

Viktiga möster för att hjälpa till att uppnå detta är:

-   [Navigate via Tension](navigate-via-tension.html) – Everyone in the organization paying attention to dependencies maximizes the potential for unmanaged dependencies to be identified and responded to.
-   [Clarify and Develop Domains](clarify-and-develop-domains.html) – When people understand their own areas of responsibility, and those of others too, they also understand where collaboration on dependencies will be necessary.
-   [Visualize Work](visualize-work.html) – Visualizing work items and the dependencies between them, makes it easier to manage dependencies in cooperation with the relevant stakeholders.
-   [Respond to Organizational Drivers](respond-to-organizational-drivers.html) Understanding why a dependency exists in the first place, and ensuring it is taken care of, is essential for collaborating on managing or resolving dependencies.
-   [Involve Those Affected](involve-those-affected.html) – To address dependencies in an effective way, it often helps to gather the perspectives of all (relevant) stakeholders and involve them in the decision making process.
-   [Linking](linking.html) – Dependencies between two teams can often be addressed effectively by sending a [Representative](representative.html) to the decision making of the other team, to ensure all relevant perspectives are considered and ownership of decisions is shared.
-   [Delegate Circle](delegate-circle.html) – Delegating the power to make and evolve agreements for how to deal with specific dependencies between teams, to a circle of representatives, brings together relevant perspectives and generates ownership among stakeholders.
-   [Align Flow](align-flow.html) – Moving decision making close to where value is created, brings together the people necessary for making decisions in response to specific dependencies and eliminates unnecessary decision making bottlenecks.
-   [Create a Pull-System for Organizational Change](create-a-pull-system-for-organizational-change.html) – Inviting and enabling people to make changes to organizational structure, when doing so provides an effective way for dealing with dependencies they share responsibility for, facilitates the ongoing evolution of a coherent and effective organization.
